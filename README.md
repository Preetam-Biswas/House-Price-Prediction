# House-Price-Prediction

1. Here we have showcased descriptive statistics to have a overall idea about the data.
2. Then we performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the given dataset to identify the top 5 variables which affect the data most.
3. Later we build a model based on those top 5 variables by using dummy variables.
4. Finally we build a model using all the variables and validated its accuracy using R-squared value.
